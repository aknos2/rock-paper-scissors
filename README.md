# rock-paper-scissors

Create a Rock-Paper-Scissors game with the basic Javascript knowledge I acquired so far. 3rd project from Odin Project.
The goal of the project is to make me practice actual coding and make me understand better how it works.
The game is going to be basic and be played entirely in the console.
